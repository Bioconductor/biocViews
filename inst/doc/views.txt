There was some discussion of task views at the Seattle 
meeting but nothing took hold of the group.

It would be very nice to have a better task view set
for the next release.  Here is my next attempt at a
vocabulary.  Once we have a vocabulary, I would like to
ask developers to add a line in DESCRIPTION that
lists the terms that they want to use to describe their
packages.  The field is 
BiocViews:

Here are terms:

Microarray
 One-channel
  Loading
  QC
  Preprocessing
  Visualizing
 Multi-channel
  Loading
  QC
  Preprocessing
  Visualizing

Statistics
  DifferentialExpression
  Clustering
  MachineLearning
  MultipleComparisons

GraphsAndNetworks

NonMicroarray
  Proteomics
  ArrayCGH
  SAGE
  CellBasedAssays
  Genetics

Annotation
  GO
  Pathways
  ProprietaryPlatforms
  ReportWriting

Infrastructure

Did I miss anything?
