\description{
  This function generates an HTML file for each package in a repository
  and generates an \code{index.html} file that provides an alphabetized
  listing of the packages.
}
\usage{
writeRepositoryHtml(reposRoot, title, reposUrl = "..", viewUrl = "../..", reposFullUrl=reposUrl,
                    downloadStatsUrl="", devHistoryUrl="", link.rel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{reposRoot}{string specifying the path to the root of the
    CRAN-style package repository.}
  \item{title}{string giving the title for the repository}
  \item{reposUrl}{string giving the prefix for URL in links
    generated on the package description pages.  The default is
    \code{"..."} which works well if the package description HTML files
    are written to an \code{html} subdirectory under the root of the
    repository.}
  \item{viewUrl}{string giving the prefix for the URL in links to the
    view pages.  The biocViews terms will be linked to views summary
    pages with this prefix.}
  \item{reposFullUrl}{string giving the full prefix for URL in links
    generated on the package description pages.  The default is
    \code{reposUrl}.}
  \item{downloadStatsUrl}{string giving the prefix for the URL in links
    to the download history statistics pages.}
  \item{devHistoryUrl}{string giving the prefix for the URL in links
    to the development changelog.}
  \item{link.rel}{logical indicating whether the index page should
    generate relative URL links.  The default is \code{TRUE}.  If you are
    generating HTML for a remote repository, you will want to set this to
    \code{FALSE}. }
